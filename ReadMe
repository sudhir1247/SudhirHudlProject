Sudhir Hudl Test Automation Framework
================================
This project is a template for sudhir's test automation framework, which provides structured and standard way of
creating automated test scripts for GUI.

This is a reusable automation framework that blends together Selenium WebDriver, Cucumber JVM (incorporating Gherkin and the BDD 'Given, When Then' testing construct)

This framework supports automation on Chrome Web browser.

The framework incorporates design principle of BDD (Behaviour driven development) which promotes
 writing acceptance tests by describing behaviour of application under test in simple english language from the perspective of its stakeholders.
 Having test written in Natural language helps the Project Team (Product Owners, Business Analysts, Development and QA team) to understand and track the requirements

Getting Started
===========================


Feature Files
-------------------------------------------------------------------
These files contains the acceptance criteria which are written in Gherkin Language and contains various scenarios.
The feature files are tagged with "@tagname" to group common feature files

File Extension:  *.feature
Location: "/home/dev/src/sudhirAutomationFramework/src/test/resources/features"  /SudhirHudlProject/src/test/resources/login.feature

Page Objects
-------------------------------------------------------------------
PageObjects are used to store the WebElements for a Web Page.

Location: /SudhirHudlProject/src/test/java/com.hudl.test.stepsFiles/LoginPage.java

Step Definitions
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Every steps defined in Feature file needs to be implemented in Step Definitions Class

Location: /SudhirHudlProject/src/test/java/com.hudl.test.stepsFiles/LoginPageSteps.java


Run Test Suite
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Test Suites are used to run a group of Tests which are tagged and represented in form of Feature files & Scenarios

Location: /SudhirHudlProject/src/test/java/com.hudl.test.stepsFiles/Runner.java


    @CucumberOptions(features = "target/test-classes", tags = {"@mytest"}, monochrome = true, plugin = {
            "pretty", "html:target/cucumber-report/runwebat",
            "json:target/cucumber-report/runwebat/cucumber.json",
            "rerun:target/cucumber-report/runwebat/rerun.txt"},
            glue = "com.sudhir.test")
    public class RunWebATSuite extends AbstractTestNGCucumberTests {
    }
