Sudhir Hudl Test Automation Framework
======================================
This project is a template for sudhir's test automation framework, which provides structured and standard way of
creating automated test scripts for GUI.

This is a reusable automation framework that blends together Selenium WebDriver, Cucumber JVM (incorporating Gherkin and the BDD 'Given, When Then' testing construct)

This framework supports automation on Chrome Web browser.

The framework incorporates design principle of BDD (Behaviour driven development) which promotes
 writing acceptance tests by describing behaviour of application under test in simple english language from the perspective of its stakeholders.
 Having test written in Natural language helps the Project Team (Product Owners, Business Analysts, Development and QA team) to understand and track the requirements
